## Authentication

An account is issued one API key by default, and additional keys can be created in the dashboard.

Authenticate by passing your API key (with no additional encoding) as bearer token in the `Authorization` header or as `key` parameter in the query string.

## Rate limits

The base rate limit is 25 requests per second with a burst capacity of 100 requests (i.e. a token bucket of 100 tokens refilling at 25 tokens/second).

Dynamic rate limiting automatically adjusts limits based on infrastructure load, allowing up to 100 steady requests per second most of the time.

Limits are applied per account and can be set manually per API key.

The following headers will be included with every response:

```http
X-RateLimit-Burst-Capacity: 100
X-RateLimit-Replenish-Rate: 25
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 76
```

<Info>
  Higher rate limits can be requested and are subject to custom pricing.

## Quotas

Monthly quotas are per account and correspond to the number of queries allowed per month. Specific quotas can optionally be set per API key.

Quotas reset monthly on the subscriptionâ€™s anniversary date and time.

## Errors

Errors are returned using standard HTTP status codes.

| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400 Bad Request`       | invalid query, check the response body for more information      |
| `401 Unauthorized`      | missing API key                                                  |
| `403 Forbidden`         | invalid API key                                                  |
| `404 Not Found`         | invalid endpoint                                                 |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | rate limit or monthly quota exceeded, check the response headers |
| `304 Not Modified`      | conditional request returned no changes                          |

## Conditional requests

All API endpoints support conditional requests to reduce bandwidth usage and make it easier to detect changes.

Send the `If-None-Match` header with the value of the `ETag` header received in the previous response. If the response has not changed (i.e. no new results), the server will respond with a `304 Not Modified` status code and an empty body.

## CORS

CORS is supported for all API endpoints and the relevant CORS headers will automatically be added to the response when an `Origin` header is present in the request.
