<Info>
  This endpoint is highly effective at identifying phishing domains,
  particularly when leveraging the [fuzziness](#fuzziness) feature.
</Info>

## Dataset

The dataset currently contains around **480,000,000** registered domains.

## Example

```json
// https://api.opensystems.sh/domains?q=microsoft

{
  "data": [
    {
      "first_seen": "2024-09-06T08:29:11Z",
      "last_seen": "2024-09-06T08:29:11Z",
      "domain": "microsoftsurfacecareservice.store"
    },
    {

## Authentication

Authenticate by passing your API key (with no additional encoding) as `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header or as `key` parameter in the query string.

## Parameters

<ParamField query="q" type="string" required>
  One or multiple keywords, a glob or a regex pattern.

Learn more about the [different types of queries](#query).

</ParamField>

<ParamField query="fuzzy" type="[]string">
  Apply fuzziness to `q`. Accepts a comma-separated list of fuzzy algorithms, or
  `all` to apply them all.

Read more about the available algorithms [here](#fuzziness).

</ParamField>

<ParamField query="from" type="datetime">
  Limit results to domains seen after this date (e.g. `from=2022-01-01`). Also
  accepts UNIX timestamp and relative times (e.g. `from=-30d` for 30 days ago).
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="to" type="datetime">
  Limit results to names seen before this date (e.g. `to=2023-03-13`). Also
  accepts UNIX timestamp and relative times (e.g. `to=-30d` for 30 days ago).
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="not_before" type="datetime">
  Limit results to names **not** seen before this date (e.g.
  `not_before=2023-07-01`). Also accepts UNIX timestamp and relative times (e.g.
  `not_before=-30d` for 30 days ago).
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="sort" type="string">
  Available sorts are `first_seen` (the default) or `last_seen`. Both are
  descending sorts (most recent first).
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="limit" type="number">
  Limit the number of results (e.g. `limit=10000`). Defaults to `100`, and up to
  `10,000`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="offset" type="number">
  Used for pagination. Defaults to `0`.
</ParamField>

## Query

The `q` parameter supports multiple types of queries.

### Keyword

Find domains containing a specific keyword.

For instance, you can find all registered domains containing the keyword `paypal` by using `q=paypal`.

### Multiple keywords

Find domains containing multiple keywords.

For instance, you can find all registered domains containing both keywords `paypal` and `login` by using `q=paypal,login`.

Keywords should be separated by a comma (`,`).

<Info>
  The order of the keywords does not matter (e.g. `q=netflix,account` will match
  both `netflix-account.com` and `myaccount-netflix.net`).
</Info>

### Glob

Find domains matching a glob pattern.

For instance, you can find all registered domains with the name `paypal` with any TLD by using `q=paypal.**`.

The following metacharacters are supported:

| metacharacters | description                                                          |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[abc]`        | match any character `a`, `b`, or `c`                                 |
| `[!abc]`       | match any character except `a`, `b`, or `c`                          |
| `[0-9]`        | match any character from the character range `0-9`                   |
| `[!0-9]`       | match any character except characters from the character range `0-9` |
| `{abc,xyz}`    | match either `abc` or `xyz`                                          |
| `?`            | match any single character                                           |
| `*`            | match any sequence of characters within a label                      |
| `**`           | match any sequence of characters across labels                       |

<Info>Glob patterns are anchored left and right by default.</Info>

### RegEx

Find domains matching a regular expression pattern.

For instance, you can find all registered domains for `xx...` variations of `netflix` by using `q=/^netflix{2,}\./`.

<Info>
  The value of `q` should start and end with `/` to be interpreted as a RegEx
  pattern.
</Info>

<Info>
  RegEx patterns are **NOT** anchored by default â€” use `^` and/or `$` for
  anchoring.
</Info>

## Fuzziness

Attackers commonly alter the spelling of a domain name to trick users into thinking they are visiting a legitimate website.

The `fuzzy` parameter lets you easily apply fuzziness to your search query and find those domains.

It accepts a comma-separated list of algorithms (or `all` to apply them all):
