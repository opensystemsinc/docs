title: "Newly Observed Domains (NOD)"
description: "While NRD focuses on the first appearance of a domain name in a registry (i.e. the domain registration), NOD focuses on the first time a domain name is observed in the DNS. Newly registered domains are sometimes purposely kept unconfigured for a period of time to avoid detection, making this data another valuable subset of domains to analyze when looking for malicious activity."
---

<Info>
  This can be extremely helpful to uncover newly registered domains for ccTLDs
  whose registries chose not to disclose registration times (`.de`, `.es`,
  `.eu`, `.au` and more).
