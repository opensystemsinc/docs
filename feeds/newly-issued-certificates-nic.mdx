title: "Newly Issued Certificates (NIC)"
description: "Nearly all malicious domains get issued a certificate — either manually or automatically — very early in their lifecycle and before becoming active. Certificates also contain valuable pieces of information and patterns when investigating malicious activity."
---

<Info>
  We **monitor**, **parse** and **deduplicate** (pre)certificates from all
  trusted [Certificate Transparency](https://certificate.transparency.dev) logs
  in real time.

<Info>
  `id` is the SHA-256 fingerprint of the TBS certificate with the poison
  extension and SCT list extension removed (when present). It identifies a
  unique certificate issuance and is used to pair precertificates and
  certificates.
