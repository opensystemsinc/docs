title: "Newly Registered Domains (NRD)"
description: "Most malicious domains are registered from a few days to only a few seconds before becoming active, making those domains a very valuable subset of domains to analyze when looking for future malicious activity."
---

<Info>
  Traditional approaches usually have a 24-hour blindspot and do not cover
  ccTLDs. We use a combination of **passive DNS**, **zone files**, **Certificate
  Transparency logs** and **WHOIS/RDAP** to detect most newly registered domains
  near instantly.
</Info>

## Format

```json JSON
{
  "timestamp": "2023-03-26T13:30:38Z",
  "domain": "info-netflix-au.com"
}
```

<Info>
  `timestamp` represents the domain's registration time found in WHOIS/RDAP
  records.
</Info>

## Rate

The current rate is around **240,000** newly registered domains per day.

<Info>
  Many large ccTLDs registries chose not to disclose registration times (`.de`,
  `.es`, `.eu`, `.au` and more) — use the [NOD
  feed](/feeds/newly-observed-domains-nod) for the earliest observations of
  these domains.
</Info>
